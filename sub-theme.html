                                Bangladesh has won two consecutive maritime disputes against Myanmar in 2012 and India in 2014 under the leadership of Honorable Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Now Bangladesh has its sovereign rights on 1, 18, 813 square kilometers area. To utilize this
                                vast sea area, the implication of Blue economy is inevitable.Blue Economy has become popular all over the World in recent years, for being a sustainable economic model to meet the economic challenges of the 21st century.
                                Blue economy has diversified the economic activities involving ocean, minimizing the investment and ensuring the balance between economic activity and oceanic ecosystem. But in Bangladesh no proper initiative has been taken
                                yet to implement the practise of Blue Economy. The objective of Blue Economy in this conference is to promote smart, sustainable and inclusive growth of non-living resources (Oil, Natural Gas and Heavy Minerals) and living
                                resources (Fish, Shrimp, Crabs, Seaweeds etc.) and employment opportunities within our maritime region.

                                Objective of this particular theme is to highlight roles of geo-resources in achieving sustainable development goals. Specific emphasis will be given on Water and Energy Resources focusing on SDG Goal 6 and 7 respectively. Geo-resources, including water
                                and energy, are important ingredients for number of other SDG goals as well. Bangladesh is experiencing rapid economic progress and sustainability of the growth depends largely on the water-energy nexus. New innovations,
                                tools and techniques are needed for ensuring sustainable management of water and energy resources. This conference creates a platform for national and international experts to share experiences and knowledge which can be
                                incorporated in policy and practices. Researchers and practitioners are invited to present their research findings, case studies and field experiences as oral or poster presentations.

                                Achieving resilience is the central goals of the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development. Disaster can destroy the achievement of human society, government, and community that have been achieved by years after years. That’s why we need resilience infrastructure
                                and society that can withstand in any kind of disasters. We can reduce economic loss and human causalities through resilience. Without resilient society and infrastructures, it’s not possible to end poverty, hunger. Disaster
                                increase inequality in the society. Poor and vulnerable groups of the society become more vulnerable due to repetitive disasters. To archive sustainability, we need to emphasis on resilience. We have to incorporate disaster
                                risk reduction (DRR) and resilience in planning, implementation, and maintenance of any development activities initiated by government, public or private sectors. DRR and resilience should always consider as the most important
                                issues in our decision making and practices.

                                Population Dynamics (fertility, Mortality and Migration) can be treated as a regional development with three components i.e., Social Justice, Economic Development and Sustainable Environment for the holistic regional development. Models of the population
                                dynamics can be employed to revisit the interactions between population dynamics and economic development by incorporating the spatial discrepancy. Population growth is faster in underdeveloped and developing countries
                                of the world. Some countries are thinking that population is burden of the country, but that trend and skill labor force may asset for the country but most of the developed countries are following laissez-faire population
                                policy. Due to that they are suffering to gear up the economic development of those countries. Bangladesh population policy is anti-natal, due to that present population growth rate is 1.02 percent. Moreover, accelerating
                                demographic transition will change the overall scenario of the future population dynamics of the World. Now Bangladesh needs to achieve Net Reproduction Rate (NRR) 1.0 for her steady sustainable economic development to
                                keep in mind to maintain eco-friendly environment. So the sub-theme “Environmental Perspectives on Population Dynamics and Regional Development” can formulate a prescription for the upcoming conference to resolve the regional
                                and Global imbalance of triangular relationship (i.e., population dynamics, regional development and sustainable environment) with emphasis to Bangladesh context.

                                Bangladesh is highly vulnerable to extreme meteorological events, which threatens not only the lives and livelihood of the people, but retards the speed of development of the country. Weather forecasting is highly challenging task all over the world,
                                not to speak of the South Asian Monsoon region, where weather is extremely erratic. Deeper understanding of the meteorology of the tropics, tropical monsoons, tropical disturbances, physics and dynamics of these processes,
                                their variabilities and links with distant events, effect of land surface and land-use changes on the meteorological processes, impact of rainfall and heat waves on soil moisture is very important. The subtheme will coagulate
                                to generation of information on the contemporary science of tropical/monsoon meteorology and modern techniques of Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) of meteorological processes. It will help to conduct in-depth discussion
                                on the science of variability of weather and improve prediction of tropical / monsoonal weather, and generate stronger interactions and ties among the experts of the world working in this area.

                                The Bengal delta comprises the world&#39;s most extensive delta system, the Ganges- Brahmaputra-Meghna delta, occupying almost all of Bangladesh and adjacent territories in India. It is not only a geomorphic feature but also controls and accelerates the
                                socio- economic development of Bangladesh through integrated land use in urbanization and housing management, communication and infrastructure development, and extraction and management of indigenous resources. Bangladesh
                                is committed to taking national, bilateral, regional, and international projects to achieve sustainable development goals (SDG). The plan of SDG coincides with Bangladesh&#39;s demarcation of maritime boundaries with two
                                of its neighbors - India and Myanmar. This gives the country immense opportunities to develop and manage the resources of the Bay of Bengal. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina acknowledged the Bay of Bengal as an economic hub
                                for sustainable development and highlighted her plans for utilizing its resources. The Prime Minister also called upon the regional and international communities to come forward with progressive strategies and outlooks
                                for developing and managing the Delta processes under Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100. Due to significant poverty alleviation and life quality improvement over the last two decades, rapid urbanization and small and medium industries
                                have flourished in Bangladesh. Bangladesh needs a high-tech production system to deliver quality products to meet the demand for the growing middle-class and the infrastructure development for rapid urbanization. To increase
                                the supply of raw materials in the form of production, Bangladesh must find and prioritize the area of scientific research and increase bilateral and regional cooperation. Joint projects on Bengal Delta Processes and resource
                                management are critical in this perspective. Exploration of natural resources in the Bengal Delta and infrastructure development for the investigation is crucial. This seminar will highlight the possibility of exchange
                                study and training programs for the research students, conduct joint research and develop laboratories equipped with modern facilities and regional/ bilateral cooperation in scientific research.
