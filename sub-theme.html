                                <br/><br/> A new economic area for Bangladesh is demarcated in the Bay of Bengal after winning two consecutive maritime disputes against Myanmar in 2012 and India in 2014. Now Bangladesh has its sovereign rights on 1, 18,
                                813 square kilometers area and a 710 km long coastline with an exclusive economic zone of 200 nm inside the Bay of Bengal. The Government of Bangladesh (GoB) has taken actions since 2015 to ensure sustainable use of oceans,
                                seas, and marine resources in order to achieve inclusive development and SDG-14 goals. Blue economy has diversified the economic activities involving ocean, minimizing the investment and ensuring the balance between economic
                                activity and oceanic ecosystem. Multi-system evaluation employing ocean observation and modeling experiments that can provide accurate knowledge and predictions regarding any ocean phenomena and impact simplifies decision-making,
                                planning, and governance for the stakeholders. The GoB has already launched the Bangabandhu-1 satellite and is preparing to launch the Bangabandhu-2 satellite, both of which can deliver remotely sensed data with high accuracy
                                in close to real-time and can help with satellite-based mapping and monitoring for effective resettling, restoring, protecting, and managing the ecosystems of the Bay of Bengal. The Blue Economy conference aims to promote
                                smart, sustainable, and inclusive growth of non-living resources (oil, natural gas, heavy minerals, and renewable energy) and living resources (fish, shrimp, crabs, seaweeds, etc.) and employment opportunities within our
                                maritime region by effectively utilizing ocean observation, modeling techniques, and a sustainable management of the ocean through addressing the challenges of climate change and marine pollution.

                                This particular theme highlights Geo-resources' roles in achieving sustainable development goals. Specific emphasis will be given to water and energy resources focusing on SDG Goals 6 and 7, respectively, and the effect of climate changes on Geo- resources
                                Management. Geo-resources, including water and energy, are also essential ingredients for several other SDG goals. Bangladesh is experiencing rapid economic progress, and the sustainability of the growth depends mainly
                                on the water-energy nexus. Technology and climate changes affect water and energy resources management. Innovations, tools, and techniques are needed to ensure sustainable water and energy resources management. This conference
                                creates a platform for national and international experts to share experiences and knowledge which can be incorporated into policy and practices. Researchers and practitioners are invited to present their research findings,
                                case studies, and field experiences as oral or poster presentations.

                                The climate is changing with soaring disaster risk and this is no longer a myth while the frail debate is with its kinds (whether the change is mostly natural or mostly human- induced). Apart from the cause of changing, each society of the present world
                                aims to attain resilience in the face of obviously happening and impending disaster risks related to climate as well as climate change. Achieving resilience is also the central goal of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development.
                                The advancements of human society, government, and community that have been made through years and years are susceptible to disaster. Without building up disaster resilient infrastructure and society, it will be hard for
                                us to alleviate poverty, eradicate hunger, slaking social inequalities, and extenuating vulnerability of poor and marginalized groups of the society as well as meet up the goals of Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)-2030.
                                With a strong adaptable society, we can reduce economic loss, human casualties and save people from becoming more exposed to vulnerability through experiencing repetitive disasters. It is time to place a strong emphasis
                                on the systematic study of the global environment and incorporate disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate resilience approaches in planning, implementation, and maintenance phases of any development activities carried
                                out by the government, public or private sectors. DRR and resilience should always be consider as the most prioritized issues in our decision making and practices. The detail study of modern day disaster and climate resilience
                                through exploring earth and climate science, social science, engineering, and management aspects is monumental to understand the intricate interplay of terrestrial processes with the built environment and develop a perceiving
                                of complex dynamics of climate, its system, and their interaction with human interventions. The climate change with resultant frequent emerging hazards and severity has made it necessary to investigate the underlying causes
                                of those disasters and to develop an effective management strategy to build a safe and resilient society.

                                Population Dynamics (fertility, Mortality and Migration) can be treated as a regional development with three components i.e., Social Justice, Economic Development and Sustainable Environment for the holistic regional development. Models of the population
                                dynamics can be employed to revisit the interactions between population dynamics and economic development by incorporating the spatial discrepancy. Population growth is faster in underdeveloped and developing countries
                                of the world. Some countries are thinking that population is burden of the country, but that trend and skill labor force may asset for the country but most of the developed countries are following laissez-faire population
                                policy. Due to that they are suffering to gear up the economic development of those countries. Bangladesh population policy is anti-natal, due to that present population growth rate is 1.02 percent. Moreover, accelerating
                                demographic transition will change the overall scenario of the future population dynamics of the World. Now Bangladesh needs to achieve Net Reproduction Rate (NRR) 1.0 for her steady sustainable economic development to
                                keep in mind to maintain eco-friendly environment. So the sub-theme “Environmental Perspectives on Population Dynamics and Regional Development” can formulate a prescription for the upcoming conference to resolve the regional
                                and Global imbalance of triangular relationship (i.e., population dynamics, regional development and sustainable environment) with emphasis to Bangladesh context.

                                Global warming is associated with widespread changes in weather patterns. Scientific studies indicate that extreme weather events such as heat waves and large storms are likely to become more frequent or more intense with human-induced climate change.
                                According to the WMO’s Atlas of Mortality and Economic Losses from Weather, Climate and Water Extremes 1970-2019, the number of disasters increased five-fold between 1970-2019. Economic losses have increased seven-fold.
                                According to the sixth IPCC, extreme events will further increase in the future with increasing global warming. Given this, to enable the public to prepare and act appropriately in such extreme weather conditions, the preparation
                                and dissemination of meaningful weather forecasts and warnings in a time-bound manner have become very important. A deep understanding of the meteorology of the tropics, tropical monsoons, tropical disturbances, physics
                                and dynamics of these processes, their variabilities, links with distant events, and the effect of climate change on the meteorological processes is very important. The subtheme will coagulate the generation of information
                                on the contemporary science of tropical meteorology, climate change projection, applied meteorology, and advanced weather forecasting techniques. This conference aims to bring together all leading academics, scientists,
                                and scholars belonging to interdisciplinary platforms to exchange and share their experience, knowledge, and research findings on all aspects of Meteorology and Climate Science.

                                The Bengal delta comprises the world&#39;s most extensive delta system, the Ganges- Brahmaputra-Meghna delta, occupying almost all of Bangladesh and adjacent territories in India. It is not only a geomorphic feature but also controls and accelerates the
                                socio- economic development of Bangladesh through integrated land use in urbanization and housing management, communication and infrastructure development, and extraction and management of indigenous resources. Bangladesh
                                is committed to taking national, bilateral, regional, and international projects to achieve sustainable development goals (SDG). The plan of SDG coincides with Bangladesh&#39;s demarcation of maritime boundaries with two
                                of its neighbors - India and Myanmar. This gives the country immense opportunities to develop and manage the resources of the Bay of Bengal. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina acknowledged the Bay of Bengal as an economic hub
                                for sustainable development and highlighted her plans for utilizing its resources. The Prime Minister also called upon the regional and international communities to come forward with progressive strategies and outlooks
                                for developing and managing the Delta processes under Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100. Due to significant poverty alleviation and life quality improvement over the last two decades, rapid urbanization and small and medium industries
                                have flourished in Bangladesh. Bangladesh needs a high-tech production system to deliver quality products to meet the demand for the growing middle-class and the infrastructure development for rapid urbanization. To increase
                                the supply of raw materials in the form of production, Bangladesh must find and prioritize the area of scientific research and increase bilateral and regional cooperation. Joint projects on Bengal Delta Processes and resource
                                management are critical in this perspective. Exploration of natural resources in the Bengal Delta and infrastructure development for the investigation is crucial. This seminar will highlight the possibility of exchange
                                study and training programs for the research students, conduct joint research and develop laboratories equipped with modern facilities and regional/ bilateral cooperation in scientific research.
